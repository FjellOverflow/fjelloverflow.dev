Hosting a thin static blog on a platform like [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) has numerous advantages but also takes away some interactivity. Fortunately, [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) exists and offers a way to embed user comments on static sites.

## How _Giscus_ works

[Giscus uses the GitHub API](https://github.com/giscus/giscus?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works) to read and store comments made by _GitHub_ users in the `Discussions` associated with a repository.

Embed the _Giscus_ client-side script bundle on your site, configure it with the correct repository URL, and users can view and write comments (when logged into _GitHub_).

The approach is serverless, as the comments are stored on _GitHub_ and dynamically loaded from there on the client side, hence perfect for a static blog.

## Setting up _Giscus_

_Giscus_ can be set up easily on [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/), but I will outline the process shortly still.

### Prequisites

Prequisites to get _Giscus_ working are

- the repository is [public](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#making-a-repository-public)
- the [Giscus app](https://github.com/apps/giscus) is installed
- the [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository) feature is turned on for your repository

If any of these conditions cannot be fulfilled for any reason, unfortunately, _Giscus_ cannot be integrated.

### Configuring _Giscus_

Next, configuring _Giscus_ is necessary. In most cases, the preselected defaults are suitable, and you should only modify them if you have a specific reason and know what you are doing. Don't worry too much about making the wrong choices; you can always adjust the configuration later on.

However, you need to

- select the right language for the UI
- specify the _GitHub_ repository you want to connect, typically the repository containing your statically hosted site on _GitHub Pages_
- create and set an `Announcement` type discussion on _GitHub_ if you want to ensure nobody can create random comments directly on _GitHub_
- define the color scheme

After configuring the settings, _Giscus_ provides you with a generated `<script>` tag, which you will need in the next steps.

## Simple script tag

You should now have a script tag that looks like this:

```html
<script
  src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
  data-repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]"
  data-repo-id="[ENTER REPO ID HERE]"
  data-category="[ENTER CATEGORY NAME HERE]"
  data-category-id="[ENTER CATEGORY ID HERE]"
  data-mapping="pathname"
  data-strict="0"
  data-reactions-enabled="1"
  data-emit-metadata="0"
  data-input-position="bottom"
  data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
  data-lang="en"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  async
></script>
```

Simply add that to the source code of the site. For instance, if you're using [Nordlys](https://github.com/FjellOverflow/nordlys) (the theme of this website) and want to enable comments on posts, navigate to `src/layouts/PostLayout.astro` and paste it into the desired location where you want the comments to appear, perhaps underneath the `<Content>`.

```diff src/layouts/PostLayout.astro
    <article>
      <Content />
    </article>

+   <script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
+     data-repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]"
+     data-repo-id="[ENTER REPO ID HERE]"
+     data-category="[ENTER CATEGORY NAME HERE]"
+     data-category-id="[ENTER CATEGORY ID HERE]"
+     ...
+   </script>

  <AdjacentPostsBar {post} slot="bottom" />
```

And it's done! You have successfully integrated comments on your site!
