When you create a Progressive Web App (PWA), you likely want your users to install the app on their mobile devices so that it appears and functions like a native app. Chrome provides an installation prompt that appears when your app meets all PWA criteria. However, wouldn't it be convenient if your app could include an `Install` button that users can click to install the app? Here's how to do that!

import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import PreviewImage from '../assets/posts/prompting-PWA-install.jpg'

<Image src={PreviewImage} class="sm:w-2/3 w-4/5 my-0 mx-auto" data-img-embed alt="A penguin standing in an icy landscape, holding a small key" loading="eager"/>

## Prerequisite

Before you get started, ensure that you have already implemented PWA support in your web app. With Vue (or Vite-based projects), you can use [Vite-PWA](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) to get started with that. Make sure your app fulfills the PWA criteria; otherwise, the installation prompt will never be invoked by the browser.

Also note, that of the the moment of writing this, its only Chrome browser that offers this installtion prompt so far.

## Catching the event

To offer the installation prompt to the user, you need to catch the event when it fires from the browser. Start by creating a file `pwaInstall.ts` and defining the `BeforeInstallPromptEvent`.

```typescript pwaInstall.ts
// define type for event
interface BeforeInstallPromptEvent extends Event {
  readonly platforms: Array<string>
  readonly userChoice: Promise<{
    outcome: 'accepted' | 'dismissed'
    platform: string
  }>
  prompt(): Promise<void>
}

// create ref to hold the event
const pwaInstallPromptEvent = ref<BeforeInstallPromptEvent>()
```

Next, we want to define the function that catches the event and stores it in the `ref`. Don't forget to export both the `function` and the `ref`.

```typescript pwaInstall.ts
function checkIfInstallable() {
  window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (event) => {

    // block the event
    event.preventDefault()

    // and store the caught event
    pwaInstallPromptEvent.value = event as BeforeInstallPromptEvent
  })
}

export { checkIfInstallable, pwaInstallPromptEvent }
```

Now we need to ensure that the function is executed at the entry point of our app. In Vue, that is the `main.ts` file. Simply import the function we wrote and call it.

```typescript main.ts
import App from '@/App.vue'
import { checkIfInstallable } from 'src/pwaInstall'

const app = createApp(App)

app.mount('#app')

checkIfInstallable()
```

## Showing `Install` button

Having caught and stored the event, what's left is to show a button that invokes the installation, if possible.

In your HTML (Vue component), you can now add this button

```vue MyComponent.vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { pwaInstallPromptEvent } from 'src/pwaInstall'
</script>
<template>
    <button v-if="pwaInstallPromptEvent" @click="pwaInstallPromptEvent.prompt()">
        Install PWA
    </button>
</template>
```

With this, the button will only be shown if installation is actually possible, and it will trigger the prompt when clicked. And that's it!
