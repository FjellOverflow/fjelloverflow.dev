# About

I'm a web developer with a passion for [Typescript](/tags/typescript/) and its ecosystem. My other interests include [Linux](/tags/linux/), [online privacy](/tags/privacy/), [self-hosting](/tags/devops/), and free and open-source software. When not at my desk, I enjoy [reading a good book](/bookshelf/) and can be found traveling and [hiking in nature](/photos/).

This website uses the [Nordlys](https://github.com/FjellOverflow/nordlys) theme, created by myself with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

import Logo from '@/assets/logo.svg'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'

<div class="mt-12 flex items-center justify-center">
  <div class="relative w-1/2 md:w-1/3">
    <span class="bg-accent/50 absolute inset-0 -z-10 rounded-full blur-3xl" />
    <Image
      src={Logo}
      class="h-auto w-full"
      alt="FjellOverflow logo, two grey mountains with stack of yellow boxes in front"
