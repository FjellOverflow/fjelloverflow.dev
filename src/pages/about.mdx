# About

I'm a web developer with a passion for [Typescript](/tags/typescript/) and its ecosystem. My other interests include [Linux](/tags/linux/), [online privacy](/tags/privacy/), [self-hosting](/tags/devops/), and free and open-source software. When not at my desk, I enjoy [reading a good book](/bookshelf/) and can be found traveling and [hiking in nature](/photos/).

import Logo from '@/assets/logo.svg'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'

<div>
  <Image src={Logo} class="w-1/3 md:w-1/6 mx-auto" alt="FjellOverflow logo, two grey mountains with stack of yellow boxes in front" loading="eager"/>
</div>

The name _FjellOverflow_ is a combination of the Norwegian word _Fjell_ (meaning mountain) and _Overflow_. It's a wordplay on the common computer science issue, the _stack overflow_, where a program runs out of memory due to errors and the virtual _mountain_ of a stack, blended together in the mountain-themed logo.

This website uses the [Nordlys](https://github.com/FjellOverflow/nordlys) theme, created by myself with [Astro](https://astro.build/).
